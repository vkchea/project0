Day 1: 
Created a wireframe using LucidCharts for home page. Looking for a minimalistic and fun design. 
Started programming the home page. The navbar was created using vanilla javascript, DOM, HTML, CSS. Utilized the old <span>, class, and display: inline-block trick to create a horizontal field. 
Some problems that occured during the process was creating an image element. Consistently kept inserting "src=" in the setAttribute() method, even though the parameters were validName: string, value: string. Another problem was that apparently javascript doesn't allow two of the same elements to be created in the same scope. Potential fix to this could be to create a new variable that holds the second similar element.
